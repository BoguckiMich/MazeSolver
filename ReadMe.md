# Maze solvers

Idea to solve mazes with two different approaches. First one is about working with picture, and second one is about recursion with left hand rule.

# What you can find in here?

1. OpenCvSolver - based on `OpenCV` library to create one path based only on picture.
2. Work in progress

# What do you need?

- Python 3+
- OpenCV for Python
- Numpy

# How to run?

These are example of simple apps, just run ```python name_of_the_app.py ```

# What can be improved?

My experience
Improve or implement algorithms to second version of app
